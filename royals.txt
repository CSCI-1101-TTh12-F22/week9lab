Now that Prince Charles has leveled up to King Charles, everyone's been assuming that he'd move into Buckingham Palace. And that Prince William and Kate Middleton would move into Windsor Castle. But not so much!

Charles doesn't want to move into Buckingham Palace until it's undergone a £369million renovation (which will take a full five years) and is instead just using it as the world's biggest office while he and Queen Camilla live at Clarence House. Meanwhile, Kate and William have zero interest in moving to Windsor because they literally just moved into nearby Adelaide Cottage with their kids and don't want to further disrupt their routine. A a source tells The Sun, “It was previously said that William and Kate would move into Windsor Castle, but there are no plans for them to leave Adelaide Cottage."

This marks a huge shift from Queen Elizabeth, who spent the week in Buckingham Palace and spent the weekends in Windsor. But thanks to King Charles wanting to stay at Clarence House, both properties are just...sitting there.
